🦠 Predicting Disease Outbreaks
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of disease outbreaks using historical data such as location, population density, climate, and previous case counts.
It applies Machine Learning (Logistic Regression) to identify patterns and predict whether an outbreak will occur in a given region.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze health-related data to detect early signs of outbreaks.

Build a prediction model to classify regions as Outbreak or No Outbreak.

Help decision-makers in healthcare and government take preventive measures.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas → Data processing

Scikit-learn → Machine learning model (Logistic Regression)

Matplotlib / Seaborn → Data visualization

📂 Dataset

The dataset can include columns like:

region → Location name

population_density → People per square km

rainfall → Climatic factor (mm)

temperature → Avg temperature (°C)

cases_last_year → Reported disease cases last year

outbreak → Target label (1 = outbreak, 0 = no outbreak)

👉 For testing, you can create a synthetic dataset or use open-source data (e.g., WHO or CDC datasets).

🚀 How It Works

Load dataset (CSV format).

Preprocess missing data & encode categorical values.

Split into training & testing sets.

Train Logistic Regression model.

Predict and evaluate with accuracy & confusion matrix.

🧑‍💻 Example Usage
# Example prediction
new_data = [[1200, 300, 28, 50]]  # [population_density, rainfall, temperature, cases_last_year]
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("⚠️ High risk of outbreak")
else:
    print("✅ Low risk of outbreak")

📊 Output

Model accuracy score

Confusion matrix & classification report

🌍 Real-World Applications

Health departments can use this to take preventive actions.

Hospitals can prepare for resource allocation.

Governments can reduce mortality rates by acting earlier.
